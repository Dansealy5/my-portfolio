# my-portfolio

In the index.html file you will see the home page which shows what I am with a picture of me and at the bottom is a quick video more showcasing my developer side.
I seperated the bottom and the top pic/text and vid/text up with a table in the html file and unordered list

In the about.html file shows more about me and my hobbies outside of work/school.
I first made a header in gold and dashed outline so it would standout, then proceeded to list out my hobbies with pictures of each of them.

In the portfolio.html fill I had two sections which showed the projects that I have completed. All thrown into a border to easily decipher which picture is with which project.

The style.css file had all the design of each page ranging from setting margins, paddings, fonts, font sizes, font colors, all the way up to making the heading bar sticky so you could scroll and the header would stay there.

Finally the script.js file saying Hello World.
